## Author notes.
I wrote this (and the Tree and Stack Recursion program) during my first year at the university. \
The code can be improved but i think itÂ´s good to leav it the way they were made. \
With some pointer operations some code could be simplified, for example when adding a new piece to the snake.

## Compiling
```
gnatmake ./snake.adb
```

## Runtime
Normal mode
```
$ ./snake 
```

Super secret cheat mode (reversing and go through the snake now possible)
```
$ ./snake cheat
```

## Tested
The code have been tested on:
- Linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS with GNAT 7.5.0 
- Windows 10 machine running WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with GNAT 7.5.0
